Her friend said she would like to do this too, but she did not know where to find everything, or how to begin. It had taken Maureen many months of research and searching to make the plastic-free, and plastic-less changes in her home. She recognised that many people would also like to make these changes, but the great investment in time to do so could be prohibitive for busy lifestyles. In addition, some of the products Maureen tried worked well, while others were not as successful. Being a Museum Professional, the obvious answer to Maureen was to make a museum exhibit experience where people could participate in educational and interactive learning activities, explore options that would make changing their plastic habits easier, and have the ability to purchase items that have been tested and confirmed to reduce plastic use while not being inconvenient.

To make ends meet while she pursued her passions, Maureen worked at numerous retail positions where she learned about product acquisition and display, and gained valuable customer service skills. She also has an extensive background in teaching, having started teaching swimming lessons to adults and children when she was 14. Before beginning her museum journey, Maureen was a ballet and modern dancer and choreographer, and danced in Edmonton, Montreal, and Vancouver. She taught ballet and modern dance classes to all ages at 9 dance studios in BC's Lower Mainland, including organising and putting on live dance performances for over 10 years. When she returned to school as a graduate student, Maureen gave undergraduate and graduate lectures at the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto, and also developed and taught children's classes at the Royal Ontario Museum. Finally, Maureen has also worked as a Recruitment Officer for the federal and provincial elections, hiring as many as 600 people in 5 weeks.
